Question 2:

Linear search performed better than interpolation search since the sample input is a small amount of data and interpolation required the array to be sorted beforehand. The sorting operation would increase the total time.

Question 3:

The linear search was improved by searching through the array from the beginning and the end of the array simultaneously. In this way, the method does not have to search through the whole array from start to finish and will finish faster by reducing the number of iterations.
