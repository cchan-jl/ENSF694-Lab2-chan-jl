# ENSF694-Lab 2: Searching Algorithm
Question 2:

Linear search performed better than interpolation search since the sample input is a small amount of data and interpolation required the array to be sorted beforehand. The sorting operation would increase the total time.

Question 3:

The linear search was improved by searching through the array in increments of two instead of one. By checking two elements for every loop iteration, the number of iterations is halved and running time is improved.
